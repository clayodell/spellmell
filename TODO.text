PROJECT MANAGEMENT

use github?
etherpad might come in handy


INTERFACE

O accept context of candidate misspelling
O allow choice of 'dictionary'
O return multiple results
O accept whole document as running context (for in-document frequencies, etc.)
X return scored results
X support dictionary updates at runtime

spell.train(dictfilename, corpus_filenames)
c = spell.Corrector(dictfilename)
corrections_iterable = c.correct(text, left_context, right_context)
  where a correction is a pair (start, hibound, list of candidates)
  and (start, hibound) is a position range in text
  and a candidate is a string.
  The candidates list may be empty (indicates an error we don't know
  what to suggest for).


EVALUATION

accuracy
  new evaluation set?
  evaluate with a confusion matrix, not just a % of mistakes?
  what specifically is our accuracy goal?
  combine norvig's old eval sets as my new development set

efficiency
  make a realistic run of a document with some errors
    (I used my chatlogs but now need something I can publish on github)
  measure startup time
  can we easily measure space use?
  what specifically is our efficiency goal?


ACCURACY

better error model
  varying edit costs
    where can I get the data?
    crude version:
      general costs different, but not content-sensitive, 
      for inserts, deletes, replaces, transposes;
      or for doubling/undoubling a consonant or a vowel;
      also, modify costs at beginning or end of word.
  consider edits at greater distance

better language model
  bigger corpus
  character-level n-grams
  use word n-gram context
    Amber (Zooko's wife) wrote a paper
  select one dialect for corpus (american vs. british)
  cleaned corpus with no spelling errors
  fix errors in test sets
  handle apostrophes: contractions, possessives
    wikipedia also uses them in pronunciations
  handle capital letters
  handle punctuation
  affix stripping


EFFICIENCY

use a python profiler? is there a decent one?

throughput
  enumerate only edits in the dictionary
    tricky with transpositions
    can we avoid redundantly enumerating commuting edits?
  cache answers?

space efficiency
  binary search of an array

startup time
  mmap the dictionary
